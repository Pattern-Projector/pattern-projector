      "wrongSizePdf": {
        "question": "Is your PDF projecting too small or large?",
        "answer": "The Pattern Projector calibration tool has no zoom because the scale of the projection comes from the size information in the PDF. Patterns from designers usually have the correct scale, so a change in scale could have been introduced when opening the pattern in Affinity Designer or Inkscape."
